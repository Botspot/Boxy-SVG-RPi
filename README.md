This is a fork of the Boxy SVG Chrome App for use on Raspberry Pi.
  
**It is 2 years out of date.** For better performance and more features, please use the **full Electron app** for Boxy SVG, easily installable from [the Pi-Apps store.](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps)

If you still want to install this for some reason...
# To install:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/Boxy-SVG-RPi/main/install.sh | bash
```
Chromium creates a menu button for you. From now on you can run Boxy SVG from the main menu, or by opening a svg image.

# To uninstall:
```
rm -rf Boxy-SVG-RPi ~/.local/share/applications/chrome-gaoogdonmngmdlbinmiclicjpbjhgomg-Default.desktop
```
